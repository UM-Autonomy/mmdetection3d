# UMA3D: UMA's 3D Deep Learning Project

## Project Description (as of Fall 2021)

The LiDAR deep learning project aims to detect, classify, and localize objects based on the boat’s pointcloud data. 

This project is a continuation of last year’s project. It would be aimed at transforming last year’s work on the 3D deep learning model into a working pipeline, then improving it with various methods. An additional goal is performing live testing in order to provide in-person insight into the behavior of the model.
